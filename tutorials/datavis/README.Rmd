## Introduction

This session will be focused on the tools and techniques more than the foundations and theoretical body of work on scientific/information visualization. And as we have only two hours, we will be spending maybe just minutes pointing to and referring you to the reading list below. Therefore we will spend the session discussion choices, libraries and of course examples of generating visualizations using R and R based wrapper packages for your projects and wider research outputs.

## Why R?
```{r plot-iris}
plot(iris[,1:4])
```
