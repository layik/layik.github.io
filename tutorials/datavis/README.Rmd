## Introduction

This session will be focused on the tools and techniques more than the foundations and theoretical body of work on scientific/information visualization. And as we have only two hours, we will be spending maybe just minutes pointing to and referring you to the reading list below. Therefore we will spend the session discussion choices, libraries and of course examples of generating visualizations using R and R based wrapper packages for your projects and wider research outputs.

## Why R?
```{r plot-iris, eval=FALSE}
plot(iris[,1:4])
```

### BaseR

### ggplot2

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```
```{r init}
library(ggplot2)
p = ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
# p 
# or 
# ggplot(data = mpg) + 
#   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

We have seen or heard that ggplot2 can also do "smoothing". We can see a simple example from the code above
```{r smooth}
p = ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
# p
```

Notice the message given by the package making it clear what "method" and what "formulae" has been use dot generate the smoothing? Let's jump ahead by exploring the different methods that are used. The results are commented out on purpose.

```{r gridsmoothfunctions}
library(gridExtra)
plots = lapply(list("lm", "gam", "glm"), function(x){
  ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = x)
}) 
# plots
# marrangeGrob(plots, nrow=2,ncol=2)
# ggsave("multiplot.pdf", ml)

```


Dataset - US Elections [@VN42MVDX_2017]
```{r, message=FALSE}
# get your csv from this link as we cannot link directly to the file
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX
d = read.csv("~/Desktop/data/us-elections/1976-2016-president.csv")
library(dplyr)
# names(d)
# head(d)
# Winner and runner up candidates
# dw = d[(d$candidatevotes/d$totalvotes) > .4, ]
d = d %>% select(state, year, party, candidatevotes, totalvotes) %>%
  mutate(percent = (candidatevotes/totalvotes) * 100)

# country wide percent
dc = d %>% group_by(year, party) %>%
  summarise(percent = sum(percent), n= n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = percent/n, n = NULL) %>% ungroup()
# head(dc)
# length(unique(dc$party))

# winning parties
dw = dc %>% filter(percent > 25)
# length(unique(dw$party))
# head(dw)

# add democratic-farmer-labor to democrat
# filter(dw, stringr::str_detect(party, "democratic-farmer-labor|democrat"))
# filter(dw, party == "democratic-farmer-labor")

# create new column to identify these two
dw$dems = stringr::str_detect(dw$party, "democratic-farmer-labor|democrat")
# dw
dw = dw %>% group_by(year, dems) %>%
  summarise(percent = sum(percent), n= n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = percent/n, n = NULL) %>%
  mutate(party = ifelse(dems, "democrat", "republican")) %>% # add back party
  mutate(dems = NULL)

# length(unique(dw$party))
dw$percent = format(round(dw$percent, 2), nsmall = 2)

library(ggplot2)

p = ggplot(dw, aes(x = factor(year), y = percent,
               fill = party)) +
  # define the colours for the parties
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label=percent),
            position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  scale_fill_manual("legend",
                    values = c("democrat" = "blue",
                               "republican" = "red"))
# p
```
