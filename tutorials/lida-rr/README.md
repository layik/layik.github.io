##### Code Sharing and Reproducible Research

This is a 30 minutes interactive session on MS Teams at
[LIDA](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk) where I am based.This README is there
to help attendees find resources discussed and others who land here.

Why?

> The replication of scientific findings using independent investigators
> … the standard by which scientific claims are evaluated. (Peng 2009)

Who does this? *Biostatistics*

> The policy was implemented in July 2009, and as of July 2011, 21 of
> 125 articles have been published with a kite-mark, including five
> articles with an “R.” (Peng 2011)

##### Code sharing for reproducibility

There is not as far as I know a convention or established method.
www.sourceforge.net to dump source code or in the case of theses, maybe
submit zip files.

##### Environment based

The tools and techniques to share code is based on the language. In this
context the two major languages as you know are Python and R (or R and
Python).

In Python an interactive document which works in browsers and supports
Julia, Python and R is called “Jupyter” from those names. Though it also
can support
[quite](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) a lot
of other languages using what is called Jupyter “kernel”s.
