### Introduction
Official [docs](https://git-scm.com):

> Git is a [free and open source](https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source) distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

You can [find](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) the "Pro Git" book from Scott Chacon and Ben Straub free to read.

But this part is important:

> Git thinks of its data more like a series of `snapshots` of a `miniature filesystem`. With Git, every time you `commit`, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that `snapshot`. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnâ€™t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a `stream of snapshots`.

### Hands on
Let us run this session with each of you doing at least one or more commands and the rest of us will follow/lead/watch.

I just copied the titles of the section two of the book here but we will do it our way:

2. Git Basics
2.1 Getting a Git Repository

Creating on our machine
```sh
mkdir repo # anywhere on your machine
git init # 
git status
```

Or show us how you can do this using GitHub desktop? I found this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop) but never tried the application.

Cloning from a remote?

```sh
git clone https://github.com/layik/eAtlas
```

2.2 Recording Changes to the Repository

```sh
# write some R code
echo "print('Hello world')" >> hello-world.R
git status
git add *.R
git status
git commit -m "my first file added"
git status
```


2.3 Viewing the Commit History

```sh
git log
git log --oneline
```

2.4 Undoing Things

```sh
# edit the file hello-world.R
git status
# undo
git checkout hello-world.R
git status
```

2.5 Working with Remotes

```sh
git remote -v 
# none?
# time to create our first github repository!
# www.github.com
# new private repo or if brave enough make it public
# come back and bring the instructions shown on github
# git remote add ...

```
Creating a repo on [github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)?

Lets be brave and send the current commits to the remote.

```sh
# try 
git push # error message?
```

2.6 ~~Tagging~~

2.7 ~~Git Aliases~~

2.8 Summary

* created our first repo on our machine
* added file(s) to it
* can check history of the "commits"
* can add remote repositories

### GitHub
There is a great interactive GitHub [guides](https://guides.github.com) pages.

#### README
The `index` file of GitHub. Just open a repository and compare what you see on the landing with the file `README.md`

#### GH pages
https://USER.github.io/repo

A repo with `USER.github.io` will translate to:
https://USER.github.io for example `layik.github.io` actually points to:
[`https://github.com/layik/layik.github.io`](https://github.com/layik/layik.github.io)

Worth mentioning R packages:
* `packagedown`
* `bookdown`
* `devtools::install_github`
* `covr`?

#### DOI
Checkout this short [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) to get one on the repo.

Do we have more time?

3. Git Branching

3.1 Branches in a Nutshell

> A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master.

Read the [rest](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) of the section in the book.
3.2 Basic Branching and Merging

Create a branch on [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)?
