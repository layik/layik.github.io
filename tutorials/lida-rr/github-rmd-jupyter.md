## GitHub rendering of RMD vs Jupyter

We can see that GitHub does render Jupyter notebooks and in future may even be bale to run them interactively. But for now there is no server to run the code according to GH [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github).

As for RMD's, for now we need to "knit" them to be able to view them on GitHub repo viewing or GH pages. Here is an example of an R Package RMD file.
